## Project structure

This is multi-module Android Studio Project. It can be compiled with gradle commands, or from Android Studio user interface.

## Project modules

- app -  all the classes related to the Android UI such as view models, adapters, views, dependency injection
- domain - in this module we place all objects that will interact with other layers
- data - contains everything related to data persistence and manipulation
- device - has everything related to Android thatâ€™s not data persistence and UI
- opentrace - OpenTrace code for bluetooth tracking

## Build Variants

Application has 3 flavours matching environments: Prod, Stage, and Dev.

Flavours have different:

- Firebase configurations
- URL for PWA

There are two build types: release, and debug.

## Setup of the app
To get started on the app, setup and configure the following:
1. ./gradle.properties

2. Firebase - google-services.json

3. Protocol version
